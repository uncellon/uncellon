### Hello there 👋

So, let's begin! My name is Dmitry Plastinin and I'm system engineer. Or not, hard to say, I worked in a small company whose activities are related to the production of reverse-vending machines which are called "fandomats" (bottle receiving machine if that sounds easier). I develop everything - from controller software on C++ to real-time monitoring on WebSockets. You can find several repositories on my GitHub page that I use successfully in our production software.

I'm also trying to figure out a little bit about writing synthwave music and drawing pixel art 🙃

Well, and also 3D printers, yes, I am interested in them. Thanks to this, my wife uses all kinds of printed stuff.
